# "Marker" tab with the ability to make a To-do list
A simple marker tab for folks who keep many tabs open in their browser. With a bonus feature of being able make quick notes. Notes can also be links using the Markdown syntax.

# What is a marker tab?
If you have many tabs open but would like to place a dummy tab with a custom message to help you stay organized, then this is what you need! Of course there are fancy browser plugins but this is plain HTML + JavaScript + CSS and it does not need access to your data.
